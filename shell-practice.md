DRY ---> don't repeat yourself

create a variable and assign value of it 

whatever you are using insted of value, replace it with variable name ...


data types:---

number 

boolean 

array

---------------------------

if [expression]
then 
   these commands will run if expression is true 
else
   these commands will run if expression is false
fi

functions:---
----------------------------
you will keep some code inside functions which is more often repeated,
and call whenever you require

FUNCTION_NAME () {
    here you write your statements and call this function whereever required .

}
