✅ Developed and maintained robust shell scripts utilizing variables, loops (for, while), and control structures (if/else, case) to automate repetitive tasks, improve system reliability, and streamline Linux operations.

✅ Implemented modular scripting solutions with reusable functions, proper shebangs, and robust error handling (exit status, redirection to logs) to enhance script maintainability and troubleshooting efficiency across multiple projects.

✅ Enhanced automation workflows by leveraging command substitution, special variables, and logging best practices, resulting in a significant reduction in manual intervention and increased overall process stability
